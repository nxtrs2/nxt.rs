NXTRS is the blog and portfolio of Simon. A software engineer by training, a musician by accident and a writer sometimes.

# So, what is NXTRS?

Back in the late 80s my neighbours had a fancy toy called [Speak & Spell](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)>). Made by Texas Instruments, it was a handheld computer that could spell words and say them out loud. A cool device and the coolest feature was a mini-game called Secret Code in which you entered a word and the game would scramble the word using what is known as a Caesar cipher and displayed the output.

When I entered my name it produced the letters NXTRS. You can try the cipher [here](/cipher).

So that's the story of NXTRS. Also, below is a photo of me from the 80s having no clue that decades later I will be using those letters for something.
