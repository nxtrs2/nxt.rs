NXT.RS is the personal portfolio of my works. I am Simon - a software engineer by profession, an amateur musician and sometimes I also write stuff.

# So, what is NXTRS?

Back in the late 80s my neighbours had a fancy toy called [Speak & Spell](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)>). Made by Texas Instruments, it was a handheld computer that could spell words and say them out loud using voice synthesis. A very cool device. The coolest feature was a mini-game called Secret Code in which you entered a word and the game would display the word after scrambling it using (what I later learned to be) a Caesar cipher (a fundamental concept in cryptography - said to have been used by none other than Julius Caesar).

And so when I entered my name it produced the letters NXTRS. You can try the cipher [here](/cipher).

So that's the story of NXTRS.
