NXTRS is the blog and portfolio of Simon. A software engineer by training, a musician by accident and writer of mediocre talent.

# So, what is NXTRS?

Back in the late 80s my neighbours had a fancy toy called [Speak & Spell](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)>). It was made by Texas Instruments and it was a handheld computer that could spell words and say them out loud. The coolest feature was a mini-game called Secret Code in which you entered a word and the game would scramble the word using what is known as a Caesar cipher and displayed the output.

When I entered my name it produced the letters NXTRS. You can try the cipher [here](/cipher).

So anyway, here's a photo of me with my first computer, an IBM Compatible XT computer. It had GWBasic on which I learned to write bad code.
