This track was recorded live on my phone on a typically quiet day around March or April of 2020 - during the start of the Covid pandemic - in Colombo, Sri Lanka. There was no central idea to begin with. I had only recently started "making" music; perhaps as a reaction to the pandemic, I don't know. I just sat down and after some fiddling around my fingers laid the notes. Still today, many years later, I still love this track and might include it on an album.

The background drone was added later using an app called Shoom on my iPad - the mix was also done on my iPad using the AUM app.
