This track started out while exploring synth sounds. At this point I had begun to really liked synth saw waves (still do) - leads and pads constructed from them. The interesting thing about this track is that the bass works like a pedal tone (staying in the same chord - just 2 notes) throughout the song but there are chord changes.

My [Session Flow](https://sessionflow.nxt.rs/) music practice app has this song as one of the demos.
