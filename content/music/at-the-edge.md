This track was recorded on my phone around March or April of 2020 - (also) during the start of the Covid pandemic - in Colombo, Sri Lanka. There was no central idea to begin with. Many years later, I still love this track and might include it on an album at some point.

The drone was added later using an app called Shoom on iPad - the mix was also done on iPad using the AUM app.
