This is the official iOS port of the Nakaiy Nevi app originally developed by [Shahee Ilyas](https://www.shaheeilyas.com).

# What is it?

"Nakaiy is a calendar system, a derivative from the Indus Valley Civilization, based on observations of subtle changes in the weather. Each Nakaiy is a 13-14 day period each with their own characteristics and weather pattern, based on the positions of certain groups of stars (asterisms). The year is divided into twenty-seven Nakaiy which are grouped into two distinctive seasons: Iruvaa and Hulhangu."

# About this Port

This port is written in Swift and (therefore) developed in XCode and it has some features specific to the iOS and iPad OS:

- Widgets to display the current Nakaiy information directly on the home screen.
- Full support for dark mode for a seamless user experience.
- Compatibility with iPadOS and macOS without requiring additional modifications.

# Fun Fact

The Nakaiy indicator gadget (the circular thing below) is procedurally made using built-in primitives. That is, they are not images - except, of course, the orange graphic inside; that is an image.
