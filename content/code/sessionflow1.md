# What is Session Flow

I’ve been working on a browser-based song practice tool. If you're rehearsing on your own or with a band then this tool will be very useful.

# Some features:

- Upload any MP3 (a song or backing track) and create a project
- Add separate instrument tracks with individual volume control
- Basic transport controls: play, pause, rewind, fast-forward, looping between markers
- Create named markers for song sections (e.g., Verse, Chorus, Bridge)
- Instantly jump to any marker
- Add instrument-specific prompts (like chord changes, instructions, cues) at beat markers
- View all prompts or just the ones for your instrument

# Tech Specs

This is built using ReactJS and uses the fantastic ToneJs audio library.
